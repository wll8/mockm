A nodejs tool that elegantly solves various interface problems in the front-end development process.

## Features
mockm is implemented by pure node/js, which means:
  - Very friendly to the front end;
  - All ecological tools of nodejs can be used;
  - Don't worry about browser compatibility, h5/small programs/app can be used;

It is actually a back-end interface service, and the simulation is more comprehensive, for example:
  - Can see the network request in the browser console;
  - Able to simulate various interface functions of websocket/file upload/download;
  - Log recording, data replay;

Simplicity is the goal of this tool, for example:
  - You don't even need to install it, just run the command `npx mockm` to use it;
  - The modification takes effect immediately;
  - Comes with internal network penetration;
  
## quick start
``` sh
# Check the node version, currently mockm supports node v10.12.0 and above
node -v

# Install
npm i -D mockm

# Create and run with template
npx mockm --template 

# Browser open http://127.0.0.1:9005/#/apiStudio/
```

The above command will generate common configuration, modify `mm.config.js` and try it out.

<summary>ðŸ‘‰ Some examples</summary>

``` js
/**
 * @see: https://www.hongqiye.com/doc/mockm/config/option.html
 * @type {import('mockm/@types/config').Config}
 */
module.exports = util => {
  return  {
    // The interface of the proxy backend, if not, leave it blank
    proxy: {
      // root node
      '/': `https://httpbin.org/`,
      
      // interface forwarding
      '/get': `https://www.httpbin.org/ip`,
      
      // Modify the json in the response body
      '/anything/mid': [`headers.Host`, `xxxxxx`],

      // Use the function to modify the response body
      '/anything/proxy/fn':[({req, json}) => {
        return (json.method + req.method).toLowerCase() // getget
      }],
    },

    // Interface written by yourself
    api: {
      // When it is a basic data type, directly return the data, this interface returns {"msg":"ok"}
      '/api/1': {msg: `ok`},

      // can also return data like express
      '/api/2' (req, res) {
        res.send({msg: `ok`})
      },

      // An interface that can only be accessed using the post method
      'post /api/3': {msg: `ok`},

      // A websocket interface, will send the received message
      'ws /api/4' (ws, req) {
        ws.on(`message`, (msg) => ws.send(msg))
      },

      // An interface to download files
      '/file' (req, res) {
        res.download(__filename)
      },

      // Get the parameters of the dynamic interface path code
      '/status/:code' (req, res) {
        res.json({statusCode: req.params.code})
      },
    },
    
    // Automatically generate Restful API
    db: {
      'users': util.libObj.mockjs.mock({
        'data|15-23': [ // Randomly generate 15 to 23 data
          {
            'id|+1': 1, // id increments from 1
            name: `@cname`, // Randomly generate Chinese name
            'sex|1': [`male`, `female`, `secret`], // Gender randomly choose one from these three options
          },
        ]
      }).data,
    },
  }
}
```

You can also [create an API through the UI interface](https://hongqiye.com/doc/mockm/use/webui.html#%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3%E7%BC%96%E8%BE%91).

## Difference

| tool        | Brief introduction | Remark
| ----------- | ---- | ----
| mockjs      | The front end intercepts xhr requests and generates data  | Can't see the request in the web console
| json-server | Use json to generate Restful api  | No integrated data generation function
| yapi/rap2 | Manage interface documents, generate interfaces and data  | Trouble installation, inconvenient to synchronize with front-end projects


## Issues
You can check the documentation first, if you still can't solve it, please click [Issues](https://github.com/wll8/mockm/issues) and describe the steps and expectations of the problem in detail.

If you think this may be a mockm problem, it is recommended to attach the relevant error log in `httpData/log.err.txt` to the description.

## Thanks
The core functions of mockm are built by these tools, thanks to the hard work of every open source author.
